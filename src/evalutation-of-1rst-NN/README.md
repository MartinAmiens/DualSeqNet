To assess the generation of an amino acid sequence, it was decided to produce a score based on the following criteria and observations:

## Is the protein functional?

1) Amino acid composition:

Natural distribution: The 20 amino acids are not equally represented in natural proteins. Some (such as Leucine, Alanine, Glycine, Serine) are very common, while others (such as Tryptophan, Cysteine, Histidine) are rarer. A random sequence will often have a distribution that is too uniform or too bizarre.

2) Presence of Key Amino Acids :

* Cysteine (C): Essential for the disulphide bridges that stabilise many 3D structures. A total absence or isolated presence would make the formation of these bridges impossible.

* Proline (P) and Glycine (G): Proline introduces rigid bends, while Glycine provides extreme flexibility. Their placement is crucial. A random sequence will place them anywhere, making folding difficult.

3) Hydrophobic/Hydrophilic balance:

Globular proteins (most functional proteins) generally have a hydrophobic core (amino acids that ‘don't like water’) and a hydrophilic surface (that ‘like water’). A random sequence will often have blocks of hydrophobic residues on the surface, or a chaotic mixture, favouring aggregation rather than correct folding.

4) Absence of Extreme and Simple Repeats :

Highly repetitive sequences such as AAAAA (poly-alanine) or PLPLPL are rare in functional globular proteins. They are more characteristic of regions of low complexity or fibrous structural proteins. A pure random sequence is likely to contain long repeats by pure chance, which is a sign of poor protein ‘design’ for a classical function.

5) Low Aggregation Potential:

Many random sequences contain “patches” of highly hydrophobic amino acids or amino acids with uncompensated charges which, when exposed to water, tend to clump together with other proteins, forming insoluble aggregates (like “lumps”). A “good” protein has evolved to avoid or mask these areas.

6) Propensity for Secondary Structure :

Amino acids have preferences for forming alpha helices, beta sheets or loops. A ‘good’ protein sequence has regions with a strong and consistent propensity to form these structures, which are the ‘building blocks’ of 3D folding. A random sequence will have a very heterogeneous and chaotic propensity, making the formation of a stable structure unlikely.

7) Absence of Internal Stop Codons (if from a complete translation) :

If you generate the sequence from DNA, it must start with a methionine (M) and must not contain any internal stop codons (TAA, TAG, TGA) that would stop translation prematurely.
